# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## **External**

I need more time to read the code and working with it to understand how it fits together.

Lack of any comments and poor naming conventions made logic function difficult to read.

## **Internal**

Lack of practice separating structure and behavior, in order to make the code cleaner and script maintenance easier.

I spent most of my time searching for new topics. e.g regexpress, event propagation, event capturing, and spread operator.
